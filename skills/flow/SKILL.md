# Flow - Context-Driven Development

## Auto-Activation

This skill activates when:

- `.agents/` directory exists in the project root
- User mentions "flow", "spec", "plan", or "implement"
- User invokes `/flow:*` commands

## Core Concepts

### Flows (formerly PRDs)

A flow is a logical unit of work (feature or bug fix). Each flow has:

- **ID format**: `shortname` (e.g., `auth`)
- **Location**: `.agents/specs/{flow_id}/`
- **Files**: spec.md (unified spec+plan), metadata.json, learnings.md

### Status Markers

- `[ ]` - Pending/New
- `[~]` - In Progress
- `[x]` - Completed (with commit SHA: `[x] abc1234`)
- `[!]` - Blocked (logged in blockers.md)
- `[-]` - Skipped (logged in skipped.md)

### Beads Integration (Required)

Flow requires Beads for persistent cross-session memory:

- Each flow becomes a Beads epic
- Tasks sync bidirectionally
- Notes survive context compaction
- Run `br status` + `br ready` at session start

## Universal File Resolution Protocol

**To locate files within Flow context:**

1. **Project Index**: `.agents/index.md`
2. **Flow Registry**: `.agents/flows.md`
3. **Flow Index**: `.agents/specs/{flow_id}/index.md`

**Default Paths:**

- Product: `.agents/product.md`
- Tech Stack: `.agents/tech-stack.md`
- Workflow: `.agents/workflow.md`
- Patterns: `.agents/patterns.md`
- Knowledge Base: `.agents/knowledge/`
- Knowledge Index: `.agents/knowledge/index.md`
- Beads Config: `.agents/beads.json`

## Workflow Commands

| Claude Code | Gemini CLI | Purpose |
|-------------|------------|---------|
| `/flow-setup` | `/flow:setup` | Initialize project with context files |
| `/flow-prd` | `/flow:prd` | Create feature/bug flow |
| `/flow-plan` | `/flow:plan` | Plan flow with unified spec.md |
| `/flow-sync` | `/flow:sync` | Sync Beads state to spec.md |
| `/flow-implement` | `/flow:implement` | Execute tasks (TDD workflow) |
| `/flow-status` | `/flow:status` | Display progress overview |
| `/flow-revert` | `/flow:revert` | Git-aware revert |
| `/flow-validate` | `/flow:validate` | Validate project integrity |
| `/flow-revise` | `/flow:revise` | Update spec/plan mid-work |
| `/flow-archive` | `/flow:archive` | Archive completed flow |
| `/flow-task` | `/flow:task` | Ephemeral exploration task |
| `/flow-docs` | `/flow:docs` | Documentation workflow |
| `/flow-refresh` | `/flow:refresh` | Sync context with codebase |
| `/flow-finish` | `/flow:finish` | Complete flow: verify, review, merge/PR |
| `/flow-review` | `/flow:review` | Dispatch code review with Beads git range |

## Task Workflow (TDD) - Beads-First

**See `references/discipline.md` for iron laws, rationalization tables, and red flags.**

1. **Select task** from `br ready` (Beads is source of truth)
2. **Mark in progress**: `br update {id} --status in_progress`
3. **Write failing tests** (Red phase) - MUST confirm failure for right reason
4. **Implement** minimal code to pass (Green phase) - MUST confirm all tests pass
5. **Refactor** with test safety — must stay green
6. **Verify coverage** (>80% target)
7. **Commit** with format: `<type>(<scope>): <description>`
8. **Attach git notes** with task summary
9. **Sync to Beads**: `br close {id} --reason "commit: {sha}"`
10. **Sync to markdown**: run `/flow:sync` to update spec.md.

**CRITICAL:** Never write `[x]`, `[~]`, `[!]`, or `[-]` markers to spec.md manually. Beads is the source of truth — after ANY Beads state change, you MUST run `/flow:sync` to keep spec.md in sync.

## Knowledge Flywheel

1. **Capture** - After each task, append learnings to flow's `learnings.md`
2. **Sync** - Auto-sync to Beads notes
3. **Elevate** - At phase/flow completion, move reusable patterns to `patterns.md`
4. **Synthesize** - During sync and archive, integrate learnings directly into cohesive, logically organized knowledge base chapters in `.agents/knowledge/`.
5. **Inherit** - New flows read `patterns.md` + scan `.agents/knowledge/` chapters.

## Phase Completion Protocol

**No completion claims without fresh verification evidence.** See `references/discipline.md`.

When a phase completes:

1. **Run full test suite** — read output, confirm 0 failures
2. **Verify coverage** for phase files — confirm with actual numbers
3. **Dispatch code review** (recommended) — see `references/review.md`
4. **Create checkpoint commit**
5. Propose manual verification steps
6. Await user confirmation
7. Record checkpoint in Beads: `br comments add {epic_id} "Phase {N} checkpoint: {sha}"`
8. Sync to markdown: run `/flow:sync` (MANDATORY)

## Proactive Behaviors

When Flow skill is active:

- Check for resume state at session start
- Run `br status` and `br ready` for context
- Scan `knowledge/index.md` for relevant past learnings when starting a new flow
- Prompt for learnings capture after tasks
- Suggest pattern elevation at phase completion
- Warn if tech-stack changes without documentation
- Enforce mandatory `/flow:sync` after any Beads state change
- Override superpowers brainstorming spec directory to `.agents/specs/` when Flow is active
- Override superpowers writing-plans plan directory to `.agents/specs/` when Flow is active
