description: "Auto-activate for .sql files, psql commands, postgresql.conf, psycopg/asyncpg imports. Comprehensive PostgreSQL expertise: SQL patterns, PL/pgSQL, indexing, performance tuning, EXPLAIN analysis, JSONB, security (RLS, roles, pgAudit), extensions (PostGIS, pgvector, pg_trgm, TimescaleDB), replication & HA (Patroni, logical replication, PITR), schema migrations (Alembic, Flyway, zero-downtime DDL), connection patterns (psycopg, asyncpg, SQLAlchemy, node-postgres, sqlx), psql CLI, and administration. Use when: writing PostgreSQL queries, optimizing performance, managing security/roles/RLS, configuring replication, writing PL/pgSQL functions/triggers, working with JSONB, using extensions, planning migrations, or connecting from application code."

# PostgreSQL

## Overview

PostgreSQL is an advanced open-source relational database with extensive support for SQL standards, JSONB, full-text search, PL/pgSQL, and extensibility. This skill provides comprehensive coverage across query patterns, PL/pgSQL development, performance tuning, JSONB operations, security, key extensions, replication and high availability, schema migrations, connection patterns for multiple languages, administration, indexing strategies, and the psql CLI.
