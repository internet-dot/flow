# AlloyDB

## Overview

AlloyDB is a fully managed, PostgreSQL-compatible database service on Google Cloud. It combines the familiarity of PostgreSQL with Google's storage and compute innovations for high performance and availability.

## Quick Reference

### AlloyDB vs Standard PostgreSQL

| Feature | AlloyDB | Cloud SQL for PostgreSQL |
|---|---|---|
| Storage | Disaggregated, log-based | Attached disk |
| Columnar engine | Built-in adaptive columnar cache | Not available |
| ML embeddings | Native Vertex AI integration | Manual setup |
| Read scaling | Read pool (auto-managed replicas) | Manual read replicas |
| Availability | 99.99% SLA (regional) | 99.95% SLA |
| Networking | Private IP only (PSA required) | Public or private IP |

### Key Commands

| Action | Command |
|---|---|
| Create cluster | `gcloud alloydb clusters create NAME --region=REGION --network=NETWORK --password=PASS` |
| Create primary | `gcloud alloydb instances create NAME --cluster=CLUSTER --region=REGION --instance-type=PRIMARY --cpu-count=N` |
| Create read pool | `gcloud alloydb instances create NAME --cluster=CLUSTER --region=REGION --instance-type=READ_POOL --read-pool-node-count=N` |
| Connect via proxy | `./alloydb-auth-proxy "projects/P/locations/R/clusters/C/instances/I" --port=5432` |
| Enable columnar engine | `SELECT google_columnar_engine_add('table_name');` |

### Connection Pattern

```bash
# From GCE VM in same VPC (private IP)
psql "host=ALLOYDB_IP dbname=postgres user=postgres sslmode=require"

# Via AlloyDB Auth Proxy (recommended for external access)
./alloydb-auth-proxy \
    "projects/PROJECT/locations/REGION/clusters/CLUSTER/instances/INSTANCE" \
    --port=5432

psql "host=127.0.0.1 port=5432 dbname=postgres user=postgres"
```

<workflow>

## Workflow

### Step 1: Set Up Private Service Access

AlloyDB requires Private Service Access (PSA) before any cluster can be created. Allocate an IP range and create the VPC peering connection.

### Step 2: Create Cluster and Primary Instance

Create the cluster with `gcloud alloydb clusters create`, then add a primary instance. Choose CPU count based on workload (start with 4 vCPUs for small workloads).

### Step 3: Configure Read Pool (if needed)

For read-heavy workloads, add a read pool with `--instance-type=READ_POOL`. AlloyDB automatically manages the read replicas within the pool.

### Step 4: Enable Columnar Engine (for analytics)

For analytical query patterns, enable the columnar engine on tables with `SELECT google_columnar_engine_add('table')`. Check `g_columnar_recommended_columns` for automatic recommendations.

### Step 5: Connect Applications

Use the AlloyDB Auth Proxy for connections from outside the VPC. For applications within GCE/GKE on the same VPC, connect directly via private IP.

</workflow>

<guardrails>

## Guardrails

- **Always use Private Service Access** — AlloyDB does not support public IP; PSA must be configured before cluster creation
- **Use the AlloyDB Auth Proxy** for connections outside the VPC — never expose the private IP directly
- **Columnar engine is for analytics only** — do not enable on tables with heavy OLTP write patterns; it adds overhead to writes
- **Size read pools based on read traffic** — do not use read pools as a substitute for query optimization
- **Set `--password` at cluster creation** — there is no way to recover the initial password; store it in Secret Manager
- **Always specify `sslmode=require`** in connection strings for security
- **Enable Cloud Monitoring** — configure `roles/monitoring.viewer` and set alerts on CPU, connections, and replication lag before going to production
- **Run EXPLAIN ANALYZE before promoting queries** — always validate query plans with `EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS)` on a representative dataset before production deployment
- **Rotate credentials periodically** — store passwords in Secret Manager and rotate on a schedule; use exponential backoff during rolling restarts

</guardrails>

<validation>

### Validation Checkpoint

Before delivering configurations, verify:

- [ ] Private Service Access is configured (IP allocation + VPC peering)
- [ ] Cluster uses a VPC network, not the `default` network in production
- [ ] Primary instance has appropriate CPU count for the workload
- [ ] Connection pattern uses Auth Proxy or private IP (no public exposure)
- [ ] Passwords are sourced from Secret Manager, not hardcoded

</validation>

<example>

## Example

Columnar engine setup for an analytics workload:

```sql
-- Enable columnar engine on the orders table
SELECT google_columnar_engine_add('orders');

-- Check which columns AlloyDB recommends for columnar caching
SELECT table_name, column_name, estimated_benefit
FROM g_columnar_recommended_columns
ORDER BY estimated_benefit DESC;

-- Verify a query uses the columnar engine
EXPLAIN (ANALYZE) SELECT region, SUM(amount)
FROM orders
WHERE order_date >= '2025-01-01'
GROUP BY region;
-- Look for "Columnar Scan" in the plan output
```

Connection string for a Python application using the Auth Proxy:

```python
DATABASE_URL = "postgresql+asyncpg://postgres:password@127.0.0.1:5432/mydb"
# Auth Proxy runs locally, forwarding to AlloyDB private IP
```

</example>

## Observability

AlloyDB metrics are available under `alloydb.googleapis.com/database/postgresql/*` in Cloud Monitoring. Enable Cloud Monitoring before production launch.

**Key metrics to watch:**

- CPU utilization — alert above 80% sustained
- Active connections — alert above 80% of `max_connections` (200 on pg18)
- Replication lag on read pool nodes — alert above 30 seconds
- Dead tuple count — high values indicate autovacuum falling behind

**PromQL patterns** (Cloud Monitoring / Google Managed Prometheus):

```promql
# CPU utilization
avg_over_time(alloydb_googleapis_com:database_postgresql_cpu_utilization[5m])

# Active connections vs capacity
alloydb_googleapis_com:database_postgresql_network_connections

# Replication lag
max by (instance_id)(alloydb_googleapis_com:database_postgresql_replication_replica_lag_seconds)
```

Required role: `roles/monitoring.viewer`. See [Observability Reference](references/observability.md) for full PromQL patterns, alert policy examples, and dashboard recommendations.

## Data Plane Operations

Before promoting any query to production, validate with `EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS)`. Monitor live workload via `pg_stat_activity`.

**Quick patterns:**

```sql
-- Active queries with duration
SELECT pid, now() - query_start AS duration, state, query
FROM pg_stat_activity
WHERE state != 'idle'
ORDER BY duration DESC;

-- Tables with bloat
SELECT relname, n_dead_tup, n_live_tup, last_autovacuum
FROM pg_stat_user_tables
WHERE n_dead_tup > 10000
ORDER BY n_dead_tup DESC;
```

See [Operations Reference](references/operations.md) for EXPLAIN ANALYZE interpretation, bloat detection, autovacuum tuning, invalid index detection, and security hardening.

## Production Patterns

### Auth Proxy Sidecar (Kubernetes)

Run `alloydb-auth-proxy` as a sidecar container alongside the application pod. The sidecar uses the pod's workload identity (requires `roles/alloydb.client`) and refreshes IAM tokens automatically. The application connects to `127.0.0.1:5432` with no credential management in the app layer.

### Credential Rotation

Store the database password in Secret Manager. On rotation: add a new secret version, update the AlloyDB user password via `gcloud alloydb users set-password`, perform a rolling restart with exponential backoff, then disable the old secret version.

### pg18 max_connections

Set `max_connections=200` for PostgreSQL 18 instances as the production baseline. For workloads exceeding 200 concurrent connections, add PgBouncer in transaction mode rather than raising the limit further.

See [Operations Reference](references/operations.md) for the full Kubernetes sidecar spec, rotation runbook, and connection pooling guidance.

## Disaster Recovery

### Point-in-Time Recovery (PITR)

AlloyDB continuous backup enables PITR to any second within the retention window (default 14 days). Restoration creates a new cluster — the original cluster is unaffected.

```bash
gcloud alloydb clusters restore RESTORED_CLUSTER_ID \
    --region=REGION \
    --network=NETWORK \
    --source-cluster=projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/REGION/clusters/CLUSTER_ID \
    --point-in-time="2025-06-15T14:30:00Z"
```

### Cross-Region Replica Promotion

When the primary region is unavailable, promote the secondary cluster with:

```bash
gcloud alloydb clusters promote SECONDARY_CLUSTER_ID --region=SECONDARY_REGION
```

After promotion, update connection strings (via Secret Manager or environment config) to the promoted cluster endpoint. See [Operations Reference](references/operations.md) for the full failover runbook and checklist.
