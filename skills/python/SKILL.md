# Python Skill

## Overview

Expert knowledge for Python development in this workspace. This skill aggregates tooling, build systems, and quality standards.

### Core Standards

As per workspace rules, the following are **MANDATORY**:

1. **Tooling**: `uv` is the required tool for Python package and environment management.
2. **Execution**: Always run python programs with the `uv run` prefix.
3. **Installation**: Use `uv` with `pyproject.toml` and install to a virtual environment.
4. **Typing**: Use `>=3.10` types as per PEP 585 (e.g., `dict`, `list` instead of `typing.Dict`, `typing.List`).
5. **Comments**: Prefer docstrings and type annotations over inline comments. Use inline comments only when the logic is non-obvious and cannot be clarified through better naming or type hints.
