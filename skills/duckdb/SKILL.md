# DuckDB

## Overview

DuckDB is an in-process analytical database with rich SQL dialect, first-class support for Parquet/CSV/JSON, and client APIs for Python, Node.js, Rust, Java, R, Go, WASM, and more. It excels at OLAP workloads, local data exploration, embedded analytics, and data engineering pipelines across local and cloud data sources.

## Quick Start

```python
import duckdb
con = duckdb.connect()  # in-memory
result = con.sql("SELECT 42 AS answer").fetchall()
```

```bash
# CLI
duckdb mydb.duckdb "SELECT * FROM read_parquet('data/*.parquet')"
```

## Key SQL Dialect Features

- `SELECT * EXCLUDE (col)` -- select all columns except specific ones
- `SELECT COLUMNS('pattern')` -- select columns matching a regex
- `PIVOT` / `UNPIVOT` -- built-in pivot support
- `LIST`, `STRUCT`, `MAP` nested types with full query support
- `GROUP BY ALL`, `ORDER BY ALL` -- automatic grouping/ordering
- Friendly SQL: `FROM tbl SELECT col` syntax, implicit `SELECT *`
