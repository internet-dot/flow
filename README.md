# Flow

**Measure twice, code once.**

Flow is a unified toolkit for **Context-Driven Development** that works with **Claude Code**, **Gemini CLI**, **Codex CLI**, and **OpenCode**. It combines spec-first planning with **Beads** for persistent cross-session memory, enabling AI-assisted development with deep, persistent project awareness.

## Philosophy

Control your code. By treating context as a managed artifact alongside your code, you transform your repository into a single source of truth that drives every agent interaction. Flow ensures a consistent, high-quality lifecycle for every task:

**Context → Spec & Plan → Implement → Learn**

## Key Features

- **Beads Integration**: Persistent task memory that survives context compaction
- **Multi-CLI Support**: Works with Claude Code, Gemini CLI, Codex CLI, and OpenCode
- **Spec-First Development**: Create specs and plans before writing code
- **TDD Workflow**: Red-Green-Refactor with >80% coverage requirements
- **Knowledge Flywheel**: Capture and elevate patterns across tracks (Ralph-style)
- **Track Management**: Block, skip, revise, archive with full audit trail
- **Git-Aware Revert**: Understands logical units of work, not just commits
- **Parallel Execution**: Phase-level task parallelism via sub-agents
- **MCP Server**: Structured thinking capabilities via Flow Think

## Quick Start

### Installation

#### Intelligent Installer (Recommended)

The install script detects your CLIs, backs up existing configs, and merges intelligently:

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/cofin/flow.git
cd flow

# Run installer
./scripts/install.sh
```

The installer supports:
- **Claude Code** (`~/.claude/`)
- **Codex CLI** (`~/.codex/`)
- **OpenCode** (`~/.config/opencode/`)

#### Manual Installation

##### Beads (Required)

```bash
npm install -g beads-cli
```

##### Claude Code

```bash
cp -r templates/claude/commands/* ~/.claude/commands/
cp -r skills/* ~/.claude/skills/
```

##### Codex CLI

```bash
cp -r templates/codex/prompts/* ~/.codex/prompts/
cat templates/codex/AGENTS.md >> ~/.codex/AGENTS.md
cp -r skills/flow ~/.codex/skills/
cp -r skills/beads ~/.codex/skills/
```

##### OpenCode

```bash
cp -r templates/opencode/commands/* ~/.config/opencode/commands/
cp -r templates/opencode/agents/* ~/.config/opencode/agents/
# Merge templates/opencode/opencode.json with existing config
```

##### Gemini CLI

```bash
gemini extensions install https://github.com/cofin/flow --auto-update
# Or manually:
cp -r commands/* ~/.gemini/extensions/flow/commands/
```

### Initialize a Project

```bash
# Claude Code
/flow-setup

# Gemini CLI / Codex CLI / OpenCode
/flow:setup
```

Flow will:
1. Check/install Beads
2. Initialize Beads in stealth mode
3. Create project context files
4. Guide you through product, tech stack, and workflow setup
5. Create your first track

### Create a PRD (Track)

```bash
# Claude Code
/flow-prd "Add user authentication"

# Gemini CLI
/flow:prd "Add user authentication"
```

This creates:
- `spec.md` - Requirements specification
- `plan.md` - Phased implementation plan
- `learnings.md` - Pattern capture log
- Beads epic with tasks for cross-session persistence

### Implement

```bash
# Claude Code
/flow-implement auth_20260124

# Gemini CLI
/flow:implement auth_20260124
```

Flow follows TDD workflow:
1. Select task (or use `bd ready` for Beads-aware selection)
2. Write failing tests
3. Implement to pass
4. Refactor
5. Verify coverage
6. Commit with conventional format
7. Sync to Beads
8. Capture learnings

```

## Track Naming

Tracks use format: `shortname_YYYYMMDD`

Examples:
- `user-auth_20260124`
- `dark-mode_20260124`
- `api-v2_20260124`

## Task Status Markers

| Marker | Status | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| `[ ]` | Pending | Not started |
| `[~]` | In Progress | Currently working |
| `[x]` | Completed | Done with commit SHA |
| `[!]` | Blocked | Cannot proceed (logged in blockers.md) |
| `[-]` | Skipped | Intentionally bypassed (logged in skipped.md) |

## Beads Integration

Beads provides persistent memory across sessions:

```bash
# At session start
bd sync
bd prime

# During work
bd ready              # Show unblocked tasks
bd update <id> --status in_progress
bd close <id> --reason "commit: abc123"

# At session end
bd sync
# Notes survive context compaction!
```

### Session Protocol

1. **Start**: `bd sync && bd prime` loads context
2. **Work**: Update task status as you progress
3. **Learn**: Add notes for important discoveries
4. **End**: `bd sync` persists everything

## Knowledge System (Ralph-style)

### Per-Track Learnings

Each track has `learnings.md`:

```markdown
## [2026-01-24 14:30] - Phase 1 Task 2: Add auth middleware
- **Files changed:** src/auth/middleware.ts
- **Commit:** abc1234
- **Learning:** Codebase uses Zod for validation
- **Pattern:** Import order: external → internal → types
```

### Project Patterns

Consolidated in `patterns.md`:

```markdown
# Code Conventions
- Import order: external → internal → types

# Gotchas
- Always update barrel exports
```

### Knowledge Flywheel

1. Implement → discover patterns
2. Log in `learnings.md`
3. Phase completion → prompt for elevation
4. Archive → extract to `patterns.md`
5. New flows → inherit patterns

## Skills Library

## Flow Think MCP

Flow includes an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server for structured thinking capabilities:

- **Structured Reasoning**: Multi-step problem-solving with purpose, context, thought, and outcome tracking
- **Confidence Scoring**: 0-1 scale confidence with threshold warnings
- **Hypothesis Verification**: Track and verify hypotheses through reasoning chains
- **Beads Integration**: Link reasoning steps to Beads tasks for persistent context
- **Session Management**: Cross-session restoration and history tracking

### Quick Start

```bash
cd tools/flow-think
bun install
bun run build
bun run start
```

### MCP Configuration

The installer automatically configures MCP for Claude Code. For manual setup, add to `~/.claude.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "flow-think": {
      "command": "bun",
      "args": ["run", "~/.flow/mcp/flow-think/dist/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "FLOW_MCP_BEADS_SYNC": "true"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `FLOW_MCP_OUTPUT_FORMAT` | `console` | Output format: console, json, markdown |
| `FLOW_MCP_MAX_HISTORY` | `100` | Maximum steps to retain |
| `FLOW_MCP_SESSION_TIMEOUT` | `60` | Session timeout in minutes |
| `FLOW_MCP_BEADS_SYNC` | `true` | Enable Beads integration |
| `FLOW_MCP_LOW_CONFIDENCE` | `0.5` | Low confidence threshold |

### Verification

```bash
cd tools/flow-think
bun run src/doctor.ts
```

See [tools/flow-think/README.md](tools/flow-think/README.md) for detailed usage and integration examples.
