# Flow

**Measure twice, code once.**

Flow is a unified toolkit for **Context-Driven Development** that works with both **Claude Code** and **Gemini CLI**. It combines spec-first planning with **Beads** for persistent cross-session memory, enabling AI-assisted development with deep, persistent project awareness.

## Philosophy

Control your code. By treating context as a managed artifact alongside your code, you transform your repository into a single source of truth that drives every agent interaction. Flow ensures a consistent, high-quality lifecycle for every task:

**Context → Spec & Plan → Implement → Learn**

## Key Features

- **Beads Integration**: Persistent task memory that survives context compaction
- **Multi-CLI Support**: Works with Claude Code (primary) and Gemini CLI (primary)
- **Spec-First Development**: Create specs and plans before writing code
- **TDD Workflow**: Red-Green-Refactor with >80% coverage requirements
- **Knowledge Flywheel**: Capture and elevate patterns across tracks (Ralph-style)
- **Track Management**: Block, skip, revise, archive with full audit trail
- **Git-Aware Revert**: Understands logical units of work, not just commits
- **Parallel Execution**: Phase-level task parallelism via sub-agents

## Quick Start

### Installation

#### Beads (Required)

```bash
npm install -g beads-cli
```

#### Claude Code

```bash
# Copy commands to your project or global config
cp -r templates/claude/commands/* ~/.claude/commands/

# Copy skills (optional - for auto-activation)
cp -r templates/skills/* ~/.claude/skills/
```

#### Gemini CLI

```bash
# Install as extension
gemini extensions install https://github.com/cofin/flow --auto-update

# Or copy manually
cp -r commands/* ~/.gemini/extensions/flow/commands/
```

### Initialize a Project

```bash
# In Claude Code
/flow-setup

# In Gemini CLI
/flow:setup
```

Flow will:
1. Check/install Beads
2. Initialize Beads in stealth mode
3. Create project context files
4. Guide you through product, tech stack, and workflow setup
5. Create your first track

### Create a PRD (Track)

```bash
# Claude Code
/flow-prd "Add user authentication"

# Gemini CLI
/flow:prd "Add user authentication"
```

This creates:
- `spec.md` - Requirements specification
- `plan.md` - Phased implementation plan
- `learnings.md` - Pattern capture log
- Beads epic with tasks for cross-session persistence

### Implement

```bash
# Claude Code
/flow-implement auth_20260124

# Gemini CLI
/flow:implement auth_20260124
```

Flow follows TDD workflow:
1. Select task (or use `bd ready` for Beads-aware selection)
2. Write failing tests
3. Implement to pass
4. Refactor
5. Verify coverage
6. Commit with conventional format
7. Sync to Beads
8. Capture learnings

```

## Track Naming

Tracks use format: `shortname_YYYYMMDD`

Examples:
- `user-auth_20260124`
- `dark-mode_20260124`
- `api-v2_20260124`

## Task Status Markers

| Marker | Status | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| `[ ]` | Pending | Not started |
| `[~]` | In Progress | Currently working |
| `[x]` | Completed | Done with commit SHA |
| `[!]` | Blocked | Cannot proceed (logged in blockers.md) |
| `[-]` | Skipped | Intentionally bypassed (logged in skipped.md) |

## Beads Integration

Beads provides persistent memory across sessions:

```bash
# At session start
bd sync
bd prime

# During work
bd ready              # Show unblocked tasks
bd update <id> --status in_progress
bd close <id> --note "commit: abc123"

# At session end
bd sync
# Notes survive context compaction!
```

### Session Protocol

1. **Start**: `bd sync && bd prime` loads context
2. **Work**: Update task status as you progress
3. **Learn**: Add notes for important discoveries
4. **End**: `bd sync` persists everything

## Knowledge System (Ralph-style)

### Per-Track Learnings

Each track has `learnings.md`:

```markdown
## [2026-01-24 14:30] - Phase 1 Task 2: Add auth middleware
- **Files changed:** src/auth/middleware.ts
- **Commit:** abc1234
- **Learning:** Codebase uses Zod for validation
- **Pattern:** Import order: external → internal → types
```

### Project Patterns

Consolidated in `patterns.md`:

```markdown
# Code Conventions
- Import order: external → internal → types

# Gotchas
- Always update barrel exports
```

### Knowledge Flywheel

1. Implement → discover patterns
2. Log in `learnings.md`
3. Phase completion → prompt for elevation
4. Archive → extract to `patterns.md`
5. New tracks → inherit patterns

## Skills Library

Flow includes 50+ technology-specific skills in `templates/skills/`:

| Category | Skills |
