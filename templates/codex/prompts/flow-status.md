# Flow Status

Display progress overview for all active flows.

## Phase 1: Load Registry

Read `.agent/flows.md` to get list of active flows.

## Phase 2: Beads Status

```bash
bd prime
bd ready
bd blocked
```

## Phase 3: Flow Summary

For each active flow:

1. Read `.agent/specs/{flow_id}/plan.md`
2. Count tasks by status: `[ ]`, `[~]`, `[x]`, `[!]`, `[-]`
3. Calculate progress percentage

## Phase 4: Display Dashboard
